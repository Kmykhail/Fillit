# Fillit

The roots of the project grow from the famous tetris game.
The program should receive a file in which a list of figures (tetrimin) is written that you can add to the least square in the most advantageous way. Of course, the goal is to find this small square as quickly as possible, despite a series of measures that are explosive with each additional room.

## File contains tetramines 4x4:
```
...#
...#
..##
....

...#
.###
....
....

##..
##..
....
```
## Usage:

./fillit [file]

Example:
```
~ ./fillit samples/some_file

.AABB..
AACCB..
.CC.BDD
.EE.DD.
EEFFGG.
.FFGGHH
....HH.
```
